      Congratulations, you've successfully installed Shopify CLI 3!

      Global installations of Shopify CLI 3 should only be used to work on Shopify
      themes. To learn about the changes to theme workflows in this version, refer
      to https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/migrate#workflow-changes

      If you want to keep using Shopify CLI 2, then you can install it again using
      `brew install shopify-cli@2` and run commands using the `shopify2` program
      name (for example, `shopify2 theme push` and `shopify2 extension push`).
      Note however that Shopify CLI 2 will be sunset in H1 2023 - specific date
      to be announced in Q4 2022.
